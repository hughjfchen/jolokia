Webarchive (WAR) Agent

  This agent is most suitable for Java EE environments. It gets deployed
  as a usual web archive. The specific deployment procedure depends on
  the Java EE server in used. E.g. for Tomcat, its not more than a copy of
  <<jolokia.war>> into the the <<<webapps/>>> directory.

  As soon as it is deployed, the agents offers its services under the
  URL of the deployed web application. For Tomcat running with its
  standard configuration the agent is then reachable under

------
http://localhost:8080/jolokia
------

   Setup and configuration of the WAR agent is explained detailed in
   the {{{../reference/html/agents.html#agents-war} reference manual}}.

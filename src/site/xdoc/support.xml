          Jolokia uses <a
          href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia">GitHub</a> as source
          repository and employs a <a
          href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests/">Fork + Pull
          Model</a> for development. The git clone URL is <code>git@github.com:rhuss/jolokia.git</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are always looking for volunteers to enhance Jolokia. If
          you would like start to participate, we suggest the
          following way:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check for an open feature request
            you like or open bug at <a
            href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/issues">GitHub</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fork Jolokia by visiting the <a
            href="http://github.com/rhuss/jolokia">project page</a>
            (use "Fork" from the menu).
          </li>

            &lt;your.name@example.com&gt;</code> to your commit message. (<code>git -s</code> will do this for you).
            Only real names are allowed here.
          </li>
          <li>
            After finishing your implementation, send a <a

          Baseball Caps, Coffee Mugs, ... over there in our

      <subsection name="Your Support for Jolokia">
        <div style="float:right; margin-right: 50px; margin-top: 20px;">

        <p>
          Jolokia is free software, released under the business friendly
          Apache License. That's mostly because I believe that open
          source software is the real driving force behind software
          innovation and I highly appreciate the fine pieces of open
          source software engineering I had the luck to use in my daily
          work. I love this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, if you want to support the development of
          Jolokia (it is still a hobby project) and you like this
          software you can <a href="http://www.flattr.com">flattr</a> it.
